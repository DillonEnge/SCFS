# Goal:
* Create a Character Generator that creates personality traits and values and process how they would interact and grow.
## Todo:
* Create a system that reads in user provided values (0-1) and randomly fills trait and value levels that aren't provided
* Create base core values list that are represented by a numerical percentage (0-1)
* Overall trait value should be a function of time, allowing 
* Input basic statistics for human birth and growth
* Create a system for characters to "work on" their unwanted personality traits if applicable from core values
* Create a processing engine to interprete life events and how they impact a characters development
